Adapted from [github-developer/using-the-github-api-in-your-app](https://github.com/github-developer/using-the-github-api-in-your-app).

This is an example GitHub App that automates the protection of the default branch upon creation of new repositories within a GitHub organization. This app will also protect the default_branch (Need to adjust the code if the default_brahcn is named other than 'master') of a specific GitHub organization upon installation.The creator of the new repository will be notified with an [@mention](https://help.github.com/en/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#mentioning-people-and-teams) in an issue within the repository that outlines the protections that were added.

Scenarios Covered:
1. When this app is intalled on an organization, all existing unprotected repo's default branchs are enabled protection  (Need to adjust the code if the default_brahcn is named other than 'master')
1. When a new repo is created, that new repo default branches are protected
1. When a new file is pushed 


This project listens for [organization events](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/#events) and uses the [Octokit.rb](https://github.com/octokit/octokit.rb) library to make REST API calls.

## Prerequisites

To run this web service on your local machine, you will need to use a tool like Smee to send webhooks to your local machine without exposing it to the internet. 

### Start a new Smee channel

Go to <https://smee.io> and click **Start a new channel**.

Starting a new Smee channel creates a unique domain where GitHub can send webhook payloads. This domain is called a Webhook Proxy URL and looks something like this: `https://smee.io/Gos6hcCFQZindeoJ`

**Note:** The following steps are slightly different than the "Use the CLI" instructions you'll see on your Smee channel page. You do **not** need to follow the "Use the Node.js client" or "Using Probot's built-in support" instructions.

1. Install the Smee client

    ```sh
    npm install --global smee-client
    ```

1. Run the client (replacing `https://smee.io/Gos6hcCFQZindeoJ` with your own domain):

    ```sh
    smee --url https://smee.io/Gos6hcCFQZindeoJ --path /event_handler --port 3000
    ```

    You should see output like the following:

    ```sh
    Forwarding https://smee.io/Gos6hcCFQZindeoJ to http://127.0.0.1:3000/event_handler
    Connected https://smee.io/Gos6hcCFQZindeoJ
    ```

### Register a new GitHub App

Next, you will need to register a new GitHub App and install it in your GitHub organization.

1. Visit the settings page in your GitHub organization's profile, and click on GitHub Apps under Developer settings.
1. Click **New GitHub App**. You'll see a form where you can enter details about your app.
1. Give your app a name. This can be anything you'd like.
1. For the "Homepage URL", use the domain issued by Smee. For example: `https://smee.io/Gos6hcCFQZindeoJ`
1. For the "Webhook URL", again use the domain issued by Smee.
1. For the "Webhook secret", create a password to secure your webhook endpoints.


    Note this secret, you need to use this later for your config/env file.

1. Under Permissions, specify the following **Repository permissions** for your app:
    - **Administration** (Read & Write)
    - **Issues** (Read & Write)

1. Scroll down to **Subscribe to events** and make sure **Repository** is checked.

1. At the bottom of the page, specify whether this is a private app or a public app. For now, leave the app as private by selecting **Only on this account**.

1. Click **Create GitHub App** to create your app!

### Save your private key and App ID

After you create your app, you'll be taken back to the app settings page. You have two more things to do here:

1. **Generate a private key for your app**. This is necessary to authenticate your app later on. Scroll down on the page and click **Generate a private key**. Save the resulting PEM file in a directory where you can find it again.

1. **Note the app ID GitHub has assigned your app**. You'll need this later when you [set your environment variables](#Set-environment-variables).

### Install the app on your organization account

Now it's time to install the app. From your app's settings page, do the following:

1. Click **Install App** in the sidebar. Next to your organization name, click **Install**.

1. You'll be asked whether to install the app on all repositories or selected repositories. Select **All repositories**.

1. Click **Install**.

## Install

Run the following command to clone this repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/shivaraman10/enable-branch-protection.git
```

Install dependencies by running the following command from the project directory:

```sh
gem install bundler && bundle install
```

With the dependencies installed, you can [start the server](#Start-the-server).

## Set environment variables

1. Create a copy of the `.env-example` file called `.env`.

    ```sh
    cp .env-example .env
    ```

1. Add your GitHub App's private key, app ID, and webhook secret to the `.env` file.

    > **Note:** Copy the entire contents of your PEM file as the value of `GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY` in your `.env` file.

    Because the PEM file is more than one line you'll need to add quotes around the value like the example below:

    ```pem
    PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
    ...
    MIIEowIBAA...
    ...
    -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"
    GITHUB_APP_IDENTIFIER=<<Your App Id>>
    GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET=<<your-webhook-secret>>
    ```

## Start the server

1. Run `ruby server.rb` on the command line. You should see a response like:

    ```sh
    [2022-04-17 13:11:46] INFO  WEBrick 1.4.4
    [2022-04-17 13:11:46] INFO  ruby 2.6.8 (2021-07-07) [universal.arm64e-darwin21]
    == Sinatra (v2.0.4) has taken the stage on 3000 for development with backup from WEBrick
    [2022-04-17 13:11:46] INFO  WEBrick::HTTPServer#start: pid=25501 port=3000
    Use Ctrl-C to stop
    ```

1. View the Sinatra app at `localhost:3000` to verify your app is connected to the server.

The web service should now be running and watching for new repositories to be created within your organization! üöÄ

When you create a new repository in your organization, you should see some output in the Terminal tab where you started `server.rb` that looks something like this:

```sh-session

```

This means your app is running on the server as expected. üôå

If you don't see the output, make sure Smee is running correctly in another Terminal tab.

Also enhanced version of this server to handle App installation event and new repo/file creation event in `server_refined.rb`. You can run that using `ruby server_refined.rb` 

## Usage

You can add, remove, or modify the branch protection rules by changing the parameters inside the `options` array in the `protect_branch` helper method:

```ruby
def protect_branch(repo_name)
  #if the branch is not protected already then protect the branch
  if (@installation_client.branch_protection(repo_name, 'master').nil?)
    logger.debug "----enabling branch protection for the repo #{repo_name}"
    options = {
      # This header is necessary for beta access to the branch_protection API
      # See https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/branches/#update-branch-protection
      accept: 'application/vnd.github.luke-cage-preview+json',
      # Require at least two approving reviews on a pull request before merging
      required_pull_request_reviews: { required_approving_review_count: 2 },
      # Enforce all configured restrictions for administrators
      enforce_admins: true
    }
    @installation_client.protect_branch(repo_name, 'master', options)
  end
end
```

You can find a list of branch protection parameters in the [GitHub Developer Guide](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/branches/#update-branch-protection).

If you change any of the branch protection parameters in the `protect_default_branch` helper method, you should update the  `issue_body` variable in the `notify_user` helper method to reflect those changes:

```ruby
# Open an issue to notify the user of branch protection rules
def notify_user(payload)
  username = payload['sender']['login']
  help_url = 'https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-protected-branches'
  issue_title = 'Default Branch Protected üîê'
  issue_body = <<~BODY
    @#{username}: branch protection rules have been added to the Master branch.
    - Collaborators cannot force push to the protected branch or delete the branch
    - All commits must be made to a non-protected branch and submitted via a pull request
    - There must be least 2 approving reviews and no changes requested before a PR can be merged
    \n **Note:** All configured restrictions are enforced for administrators.
    \n You can learn more about protected branches here: [About protected branches - GitHub Help](#{help_url})
  BODY
  logger.debug 'Creating a new issue for automatic branch protection'
  @installation_client.create_issue(@repo, issue_title, issue_body)
end
```
